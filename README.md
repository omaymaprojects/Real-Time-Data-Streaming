#Real-Time Data Streaming

Project Description:

This project is designed to implement a real-time data streaming pipeline using technologies such as Kafka, Flink, and PostgreSQL. The pipeline ingests data from a producer, processes it in real-time, and then stores the results in a database for further analysis.

Features:

Real-time data ingestion using Kafka
Stream processing using Apache Flink
Data storage and querying with PostgreSQL
Scalable and fault-tolerant architecture
Technologies Used
Python: For producing data streams.
Kafka: As the message broker for data streams.
Flink: For real-time stream processing and aggregation.
PostgreSQL: For data storage and retrieval.
Docker: For containerizing the application components.
Maven: For managing dependencies and building the Flink application.
